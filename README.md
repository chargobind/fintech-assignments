## General Info
This assignment (case study) focuses on the Mortgage/Real Estate sector of Fintech. It will explore how Divvy Homes is becoming a driving force within this domain. This case study will outline four major sections including the Business Activities, Landscape, Results, and Recommendations for Divvy Homes. Business Activities will introduce how Divvy Homes is attempting to disrupt the Mortgage industry; Landscape will investigate a micro-view understanding of the positioning of Divvy Homes within the Fintech Industry; Results will focus on the impact Divvy Homes has in the particular domain of Fintech it is establishing itself within; and finally, personal recommendations that will suggest a few ideas as to how Divvy Homes can better develop its infrastructure and services.  

## Overview and Origin
![Divvy Homes](./file:///Users/charleshargobind/Desktop/Divvy.png)
> Founded: 2017
> Founders: Adena Heftes, Brian Ma, Nick Clark, Alex Klarfel
> Insight: Adena Heftes has a goal to help everyone own a home of their own someday so that they can live the American Dream regardless of their financial history. 
> Funding: Divvy Homes is currently in Series C funding. To date they have received a total of 290 Million USD.  


## Business Activities
> Divvy Homes is attempting to disrupt the Mortgage industry as they believe that mortgage requirements have gotten more restrictive while people’s financial lives are more complex than ever. Divvy wishes to help the millions of Americans who are excluded from homeownership, not because they can’t afford it but because they simply can’t get approved for a mortgage. Divvy represents an entirely new way to think about homeownership. While Divvy Homes has a reach that can speak to many individuals globally their current customer focus is middle-class Americans who have been locked out of the traditional mortgage system. Generally speaking, their customers have, on average, about $4,000 saved up in the bank, about $60-80,000 in income, and generally have about a 635 FICO score. Usually, this reflects a couple that is settling down with kids or participating in a similar life event. Given this understanding and approach Divvy Homes stands alone from its competitors in many ways, some being; 
* Optional customer home purchase through a monthly rent model 
* Only 6 months of income is considered 
* No long-term contract required
* Allows the customer to choose their own home, rather than placing them in undesirable locations

> Divvy has not only provided a customer central focused structure within their organization, but also has recognized the need to incorporate emerging technologies into what it is that they are doing. By utilizing more than 25 technologies Divvy keeps its growth mindset as a competitive advantage; some the technologies used amongst many are Cloud Computing and HTML5. 



## Landscape
> Within the PropTech (Mortgage/Realestate) Domain there are many innovations that have taken place within the last 5-10 years; including Big Data, AI and Machine Learning, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, 5G, Drones, and Blockchain. Big Data has assisted this domain by allowing companies to compile and sometimes collect data on buying and selling trends in a specific area, traffic, demographic information, consumer survey results, etc. Companies are then able to analyze and collate that data to offer insights on pricing, home-value trends, and potential value in certain neighbourhoods. AI and Machine Learning provide service to this domain through property search sites that rely on simple preferences like location and size to display properties for sale; in the near future, however, AI may enable these sites to recommend properties based on preferences, personality traits, and values. Virtual and Augmented Reality provides Realtors with the ability to create virtual reality tours of properties that potential buyers can experience from the comfort of their own home, or to help long-distance buyers virtually tour properties they can't physically visit. IOT has the potential to provide homebuyers with a comprehensive history of a home’s maintenance and upkeep through its smart devices connected to the electrical, HVAC, and plumbing. This will inevitably empower the individual to no longer guess or pay for costly inspections to understand the condition of a house. With 5G, it will be easier (and less expensive) to connect many sensors and cameras around a property. These devices will be able to capture higher definition images and transmit them almost instantaneously anywhere with regards to home security. Additionally, Drones provide relatively easy and budget-friendly aerial photography that would have been prohibitively expensive just a few years ago. Finally, Blockchain can have a number of real estate applications, such as legal contracts, financing, buying and selling a property, and so on. Blockchain can add an additional level of trust in a real estates business activity, such as transactions and leasing. 

> While many companies within this domain are utilizing these new advances some notable ones are companies like Point, Loftium, Kabbage, Provito, Homevest, CoBuy, Zerodown, and Flyhomes which are all expanding their funnels into homeownership. Some additional major companies in this domain are  Zillow, Trulia, and Redfin. 



## Results
> While Divvy Homes has seen numerous results while only being in Series C Funding, they continue to make an impact. Through Divvy opening up their activities to a wider group of buyers by allowing cornered-in home seekers to take possession of a house for as little upfront and then paying above-market monthly rent, by the end of three years, customers will have built up as much as 10% equity. Through this approach, Divvy has become operational in 16 markets, with plans to expand to 20 by year’s end (mainly because of the new funding.) According to Adena Heftes Divvy's annual revenue is well above $20 million. While she continues to decline the company’s current valuation, though it was valued at $163 million as of June 2019, according to PitchBook. Divvy competes against many regional firms, as well as Home Partners, Dream America and others. With respect to Divvy's performance amongst its competitors, Divvy provides a more personalized customer experience that differs from their competition in the same domain by; 
* Making it easier to buy a home, give that mortgage rates dropped to historic lows in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which caused banks to tightened underwriting requirements for approvals
* Providing renters with the option to purchase their home, Divvy claims to be different from other real estate tech companies in that it aims to digitize “the archaic, data-heavy processes buyers encounter along the way.”
* Supports customers with ancillary product offerings such as, helping customers through title & escrow, inspections, negotiating and repairs. Ultimately, Divvy wants to “create a complete end-to-end experience,” from providing realtors to serving as a lender.

## Recommendations
> While Divvy is providing phenomenal services to its current clientele, if I was to advise the company I would suggest the following; 
* VR Studios 
* Home Lottery
* Customer Personality Test

> A Virtual Reality studio and/or database can be used to allow customers the experience of walking-through potential homes from the comfort of their living room or a designated retail location in which host branded Divvy real-estate agents to provide services to potential customers. The technologies required for such an idea would be minimal as it would simply need a programmer who can develop such a database using languages such as C/C++, a hiring process of real estate agents, and obtaining a retail location within a mall and/or similar location. If Divvy was to adapt this idea they can advertise its new VR feature through a Home Lottery (this can be done annually as well), A home lottery give-away would replicate current similar home lotteries such as the Princess Margaret Home Lottery. This would require some overhead cost and attention of Divvy's marketing team, but would reap rewards long-term with cost-efficient measures. An additional feature that can be used in collaboration with the Home Lottery recommendation would be customer personality tests. By having customers engage in an optional personality test they will begin to learn more about their clientele and gamify the house buying experience through the recommendations of properties that best suit various personality preferences, traits, and values. Such an additional feature to Divvy Homes would require the technologies of AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data. 

> In summation, Divvy Homes appears to be a driving force within the PropTech Domain. If they continue their momentum I believe they can reach a global scale and mimic the influence Uber has on the transportation industry but within Real Estate.
